You can find the database by going to "https://fbref.com/en/comps/24/2022/2022-Serie-A-Stats", 
you should go to each of the 20 teams that played the championship and use the following tables:
1) Goalkeeping
2) Advanced Goalkeeping
3) Shooting
4) Passing 
5) Pass Types
6) Goal and Shot Creation
7) Defensive Actions
8) Possession 
9) Playing Time 
10) Miscellaneous Stats

The idea is to create a performance indicator considering each position.
Enjoy it!
